# Simple Mandelbrot set explorer
This is a small project to view the Mandelbrot set using Java. The program is pretty simple and only runs on your CPU but has no multithreading. 

### Controls
Pan with left mouse and zoom with the scroll wheel to move around. You can turn up the iterations with shift+scroll, or you can hold middle click and move your mouse. Right click to show the path the complex numbers take as they iterate.
